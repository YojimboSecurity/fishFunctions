## Abstract

I have a lot of functions that I use in my day to day work that I would like to share with the community. I have tried to make them as simple as possible, but I am still learning. I am open to suggestions and feedback.

## Getting Started

Naturally, you need to install [fish](http://fishshell.com/). I also recommend installing [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/bpinto/oh-my-fish).

Copy one or all files to your `~/.config/fish/functions/` directory.

    cp functions/* ~/.config/fish/functions/

You may also link one or more files to your `~/.config/fish/functions/` directory.

    ln -s functions/* ~/.config/fish/functions/
